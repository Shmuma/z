1.3:

 - add value mapping for messages
 - parameter to disable log rotation
 - fix order for displaying log files order by clock desc,id desc
 - use of aggregates in triggers
 - make grid 0,20,40,60,80,100 in graphs
 - does ZABBIX maintain Host availability of monitored by SNMP
 - when unlinking a host from template, add option (Unlink&Delete, Unlink Only)

 - remember different default values in different forms
 - server side checks (new type of check)

 - new item status: not available. If agent doesn't accept parameter.
 - new function for item status to enable sending of notification in case if an item changes status to unknown (for example)
 - do zabbix_sender for windows
 - http://www.zabbix.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1141&page=3&pp=10
 - update trigger value immediately after add or update

TKOM:

 - alarms forwarding to external systems (using SNMP traps, for example)
 - alarm/trigger sounds

 - rus/lat characters for graphs
<?
print_r($_POST);
?>
<form method="POST" action="">
<input type="image" src="images/image.jpg" name="imgname">
</form>

4. SNMP traps. Make possible action definition for the SNMP trap-related
 events.

OTHER:

 - multi-institution support

'-' doesn't work in trigger expressions (a-b=0)

 - negative values in graphs
 - check all screens if they are user friendly and present information in the best possible way
 - possibility (a button) to recheck unsupported parameters
 - add advanced task scheduler/executor to ZABBIX
 - agent incorrectly returns amount of free/available memory on HP-UX (must be 24GB)

 - add icons to a map by clicking mouse

 Kak naschet dopolnenij k time & date:
 * tipa month, day, year, hour, minute, ...

 Nu i k 'str' dodlstj csjakie vsjakosti tipa
 * substr, length, poisk pozicii simvola/podstroki (FIND/SEARCH v Excel),
 podscet kolichestva simvola (tipa skoljko tam zapjatih)...

 - add requirement for fping to the manual
 - separate login.php and index.php
 - remove icmpping and others from the QUEUE

 - summarising report about triggers/actions/items. Show items without triggers,
trigger wihout actions, etc etc
 5) When adding trigger, next page is without triggers of this host. Is  
 it possible after adding triger to go back to triggers of this host page ?

 - zabbix thinks that host is unrechable if it receives string for numeric item

 - think about implementation of sinchronised items like cpu[usr], cpu[sys], cpu[idle]

 - implement complex SLA calculation (donwtimes, working/non-working hours), etc. See
forum Open Discussion for more info.
 - add selection of MIN/MAX/AVG for graphs
 - stacked graphs

LATER:

 - check return code for alert scripts
 - trapper item. Source->Alarms do not grow when last status is unknown for
latest trigger (item type  = TRAPPER)
 - SNMP traps. Condition to switch expression off. New function which would return
 status of the trigger could help. 

 - when zabbix cannot evaluate expression it does not change status to UNKNOWN but adds ALARM (UNKNOWN) 
 - preset time for graphs

 - links to Zabbix frontend in alert emails
 - strings items for graphs
 - zabbix_trapperd does not start if PostgreSQL and DBConnectOnEach=1

 - [10] Refresh stop ability. At least for graphs and triggers being selected.
 - [10] IT Services. Show downtimes for weeks.
 - [10] IT Services. User view, show algorithm.
 - [10] BUG. When adding new service, service name is wrong.
 - [10] IT Services. SLA for a period of time only (09:00-18:00)

LS:

 - graphs. Dobavljatj item so smescheniem vo vremeni
 - check permissions for zabbix_agentd when started under root
 - add item to group (not to all)
 - update host from template

trend(N) - linejnaja aproksimacija sled.znachenija po interval vremeni N;
trend(N,M) - tozhe, no ne sled.znachenie, a vpered na interval vremeni M;

nu i massu matematicheskih mozhno - dlja super-advanced chuvakov:
* SQRT, LOG, LOG10, trigonometricheskie, ...

 - if 'Update', then default action (button 'Enter') must be Update
 - do not check SNMP port existance if Item is not SNMP
 - add item to host group
 - add descriptions to items
 - link host (group) to template

graphs:

 - min value (0 or automatic)
 - customisation of font size
 - link items to show them in one graph (network in/out) 

 - snmp oid symbolic representation
 - Latest values->Host->[Show not monitored]

HP:

 - add threshold,min,max line for user-defined graphs

 - [4] Latest values. Link to page which shows list of all triggers-related
 to the item.
 - [4] users.php. Link to page which shows all actions defined for this user.
 - [5] Configuration of items/triggers. Add Select.
 - [7] SLA algorithm (A - 0%, B - 100% -> availability of AB = 50%)
 - [7] IT Service % must start at 01.01.20xx, not first day of the week
 - [7] ALARMS. Ability to select events by specifying date from/to.
 - [9] History of who and when changed trigger comment. As starting point: who and when
 did latest changes.
 - [9] ... the history to be used to see who did changes and who wrote specific parts
 of comments to know who is in charge for the instructions
 - [9] ... find outdated instructions to initiate its renewal (review)

LS:

 - detailed description for items

TOP PRIORITY:

 - fix update of 'status'. When added it never gets updated, if server is already unreachable.
 - add more checks for forms (check all possible wrong values)
 - support of fetch_html[*]
 - zabbix_agentd to support swap[*] and memory[*] onder AIX

BUGS:

 - add protection from IT Service looping

DIFFERENT TASKS:

 - SNMP trapping
 - distributed monitoring
 - personalisation (refresh rate, graph size, default graph period, etc)
 - SNMP-walk in WEB interface
 - add UserParameter without restart of an agent

TODO:

- Agent
 1. An API so that I can build and active agent into
    the centralized monitoring point of my application.
 2. max/min/average values during the poll pause along with last value to catch
CPU spikes otherwise invisible (have had these problems with BMC Patrol).
 3. Ability to add a library of  userwritten c-functions with dlopen/dlsym to
the agent with a predefined API that can return values to suckerd.

Not ready yet:

1. Monitoring of Windows (2000) services via SNMP
This is an extension I wrote based on your SNMP checker that scans through the Windows SNMP mib to check if a specified
+process is running. I thought it may be able to be used in a similar situation to the new SIMPLE check.

2. Basic schedule to monitor certain items during specified period.
I made changes to the PHP frontend and zabbix_sucker.c to enable the user to specify a time period (like between 9am-5pm) when
+the item should be checked.
(From: "Dave McCrudden" <dmccrudden@custcare.com.au>)


 - do not send notifications at certain periods of time. Do not monitor services at certain periods of time.
 - decrease number of TCP connections between server and agent
 - add triggers for all hosts at once
 - check new Mariusz patches
 - add support for downtimes, user availablity, etc

HB:

 - LDAP authorisation (should work with MSWindows LDAP)

 OTHER:

 - collect network and other statistics using kstat()
 - support for complex reports
 - update trigger status to UNKNOWN if cannot evaluate function 

 LATER:

 - setup demo site
