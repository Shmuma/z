This gateway must run in any unix/linux system with Perl 5.005 or greater
installed. Perhaps 5.004 is enough.

The gateway uses the following Perl modules:

IO::Socket
Net::hostent
Sys::Syslog
Digest::MD5

Net::hostent and Sys::Syslog are not a requirement, but recomendable.
Digest::MD5 is needed if you want to authenticate ip clients using a
user/password validation like CHAP does.

Please, notify me at "AndresSH@alamin.org" if you need any change to run
it in your unix/linux.
