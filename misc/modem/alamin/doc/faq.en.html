<h2><a name="whatgateway" href = "#tocwhatgateway">What is an SMS message gateway?</a></h2>
<p>In general, a gateway is a program that allows systems using different
data formats to connect to each other in as transparent a way as possible.</p>
<p>In an SMS message gateway, one end of the gateway is connected to a
mobile telephone network, over which SMS messages are sent.  The other
end of the gateway can be connected to different systems or services.
These most commonly include mail systems and IP networks.</p>]
<p>The main objective of the gateway is to send SMS messages from clients
that do not have the necessary means, and to receive SMS messages to
be processed or resent by some other means within the IP network.<p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="whatalamin" href = "#tocwhatalamin">What is Alamin?</a></h2>
<p>Alamin is an implementation of the SMS message gateway.  Written
in Perl, its principle objective is ease of use, especially in
its setup.  Security and reliability are two other important
considerations.</p>
<p>Alamin works by using three daemons that exchange messages via a
spool, similar to an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent).  Actually, it is an
MTA for SMS messages.</p>
<p>On the IP network side of the gateway, at present only the SMSQP and SMTP
protocols are implemented, but POP and IMAP implementations are
anticipated.</p>
<p>On the mobile phone network side, extended AT commands are being used
for communicating with GSM modems and calls to gnokii of the project
of the same name for communicating with Nokia telephones supported by
this project.  In both cases, only the functionality of sending and
reading SMS messages is used.</p>
<p>Alamin is also an old district of Guadalajara, a Spanish city
close to Madrid.  During the Middle Ages one of the areas was located
outside of the walls of the city, along with one of its gates, the
Alamin, topped by a tower which still stands today.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="smsqp" href = "#tocsmsqp">What is the SMSQP protocol?</a></h2>
<p>SMSQP stands for "Short Message Service Queue Protocol."  It is a new
protocol developed to connect to the gateway with clients from an IP
network.</p>
<p>In September 2000 a request was made to IANA to reserve a TCP port to
be used by this protocol.  In October IANA reserved TCP port 11201 for
this protocol.</p>
<p>The protocol is designed to manage short message queues waiting to be
sent, as well as for making requests to send short messages and for
removing those requests.  It includes requests to report the status of
the queue, GSM devices and gateway services.</p>
<p>The protocol has not been completely defined as of yet, since the
definition is tied to the Alamin gateway project.  You can check on
its progress by reading the debugging logs generated by the core
modules (GSGCMD) and the client (GSGC) of the Alamin project.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="whattodo" href = "#tocwhattodo">What is an SMS-to-IP gateway good for?</a></h2>
<p>There are many applications that can use an SMS-to-IP gateway.
Basically, the objective is to extend to the GSM network the
functionality of client/server applications that currently run on IP
networks, and to facilitate the access to various resources from
mobile telephones that have the ability to send and receive short
messages.</p>
<p>Some of the applications commonly used with other message gateways
include banking services via GSM, SMS chats, information services of
various types (betting results, traffic and weather reports, etc.),
and information services for computer equipment.</p>
<p>By using applications that work through the gateway, Alamin gives
access to any service capable of being based on a question-and-answer
scheme by implementing IMPs (Input Message Processors) that analyze
the message coming from a mobile telephone, act according to the
message, and respond via the Alamin gateway client.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="whatdoyouneed" href = "#tocwhatdoyouneed">What do I need to start using an SMS-to-IP gateway?</a></h2>
<p>A computer to be used as the gateway server, a GSM device, and a way
to connect the two.</p>
<p>As a GSM device, Alamin supports GSM modems that understand the
extended AT command set and support text mode for sending SMS messages
(PDU mode isn't supported at present, but there are plans to implement
it) or Nokia telephones supported by the Gnokii project
(http://www.gnokii.org).</p>
<p>Whichever GSM device you choose, you will need a connection cable to
the serial port of the computer.  If one isn't available, an infrared
port in both the GSM device and computer is needed.  Infrared devices are not
recommended for permanent or working gateways due to high battery
usage for the mobile phone and the rapid self-disconnect that some
models use.</p>
<p>GSM modems should be used with transformers attached to some structure
or wall.  This will avoid problems with charging/discharging the
mobile phone batteries as well as with instabilities caused by
interference from the position of the GSM equipment with respect to
nearby computers.</p>
<p>A page in the project website lists devices that have been tested and
are compatible with the SMS-to-IP gateway.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="gsmdevice" href = "#tocgsmdevice">What is a GSM device?</a></h2>
<p>A mobile telephone with GSM technology or GSM modem.</p>
<p>At present, Alamin uses GSM devices.  With the coming of the new GPRS
and UMTS networks, the necessary modifications will be added for new
communications equipment.</p>
<p>The future of the SMS service appears to be guaranteed due to its
widespread use.  Even if the device used to access the mobile
network changes, mobile telephone providers will probably make it a
priority to maintain this service, which is what Alamin is based
on.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="operator" href = "#tocoperator">What mobile phone providers should I choose?</a></h2>
<p>Many mobile phone providers offer electronic mail gateway services to
SMS messages free of charge.  In many cases this service is deficient
due to long delays, periods of unavailability, or even by limiting the
number of messages per user and the days permitted.</p>
<p>Since you finally have GSM equipment connected to the gateway
computer, and it is this equipment that sends the messages, these
messages usually have a fixed cost on the part of the telephone
provider.  Once the volume of messages that will be sent is known, a
price renegotiation with the provider is recommended to try to set it
at an adequate level.</p>
<p>Some mobile phone operators permit direct IP access to their SMSC
(Short Message Server Center).  The cost to access this service should
be analyzed, but for extremely large volumes of sent messages, it
could be interesting.  Alamin does not allow direct access by IP to
the central short message server at present.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="connect" href = "#tocconnect">How do I connect a telephone or modem to the computer?</a></h2>
<p>Each GSM device can have one way to connect.  In any case, GSM modems
are connected to the computer's serial port.  Each mobile phone usually
has a kit to connect to the computer.  Read the documentation for your
mobile phone or contact your service provider.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="serverreq" href = "#tocserverreq">What are the requirements for a gateway server?</a></h2>
<p>The following applies to version 0.3.6.</p>
<p>The gateway server was developed on GNU/Linux systems and is known
to work on Solaris and BSD.  In any case, there shouldn't be any
problems with any Linux system that has Perl 5.004 or 5.005 and the
following modules installed:  IO::Socket, Net::hostent, Sys::Syslog
and Digest::MD5.</p>
<p>You will need a free serial port, a GSM device that can
connect to the serial port, a kit or data cable for the GSM device and
its documentation, for making sure it is correctly connected to the gateway.</p>
<p>With regard to memory requirements, the three daemons that comprise
the gateway require approximately 18 MB.  Future versions of the
gateway will be optimized to use less memory.</p>
<p>The consumption of processor time is very low when idle, since two of
the daemons are waiting for TCP connections most of the time, and the
third checks the GSM device periodically for incoming messages, with
pauses between checks.</p>
<p>During periods of high load sending and receiving messages, CPU
usage has been observed not to exceed 10 percent on a
Pentium II 266.</p>
<p>If you expect a high level of utilization, you should anticipate a
certain consumption of the spool and log directories /var/spool/alamin
and /var/log/alamin.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="client" href = "#tocclient">On which systems can I use the gateway client?</a></h2>
<p>The following applies to version 0.3.6.</p>
<p>The gateway's client program (gsgc) has few requirements.  The only
thing the client needs is an interpreter
for Perl 5.004 or 5.005 with IO::Socket, Sys::Syslog and Digest::MD5
modules.</p>
<p>The client program was developed on GNU/Linux systems and is known to
work correctly on Solaris and BSD.  In order to use gsgc in Windows,
you will need to install ActivePerl, the Digest::MD5 module, and patch
the program to prevent it from using the Sys::Syslog module.  There
don't appear to be any implementations of this module for Windows. In
the "otherOS" directory of the .tar.gz file, a client with this patch
has already been created.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="why" href = "#tocwhy">Why do I want to connect my application to the gateway?</a></h2>
<p>To equip it with greater ease of access when you don't find yourself
near a computer.</p>
<p>Imagine accomplishing everyday tasks or do real work from any part of
the world by means of a simple short message - fantastic - it's real
and it works.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="how" href = "#tochow">How do I connect my application to the gateway?</a></h2>
<p>For your application to send messages, simply call the client,
gsgc, with the appropriate parameters.</p>
<p>For your application to receive messages, implement a simple IMP
(Incoming Message Processor) that will transform the message into
something understandable by your application, or that invokes your
application with the necessary parameters.</p>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</PRE>
<P>
<STRONG>0. PREAMBLE</STRONG>
<P>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.
<P>
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
<P>
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
<P>

<STRONG>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</STRONG>
<P>
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".
<P>
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
<P>
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
<P>
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.
<P>
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.
<P>
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
<P>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.
<P>
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
<P>

<STRONG>2. VERBATIM COPYING</STRONG>
<P>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
<P>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
<P>

<STRONG>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</STRONG>
<P>
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
<P>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
<P>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.
<P>
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
<P>

<STRONG>4. MODIFICATIONS</STRONG>
<P>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>A.</STRONG> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
<LI><STRONG>B.</STRONG> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
<LI><STRONG>C.</STRONG> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
<LI><STRONG>D.</STRONG> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
<LI><STRONG>E.</STRONG> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
<LI><STRONG>F.</STRONG> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
<LI><STRONG>G.</STRONG> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
<LI><STRONG>H.</STRONG> Include an unaltered copy of this License.
<LI><STRONG>I.</STRONG> Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
<LI><STRONG>J.</STRONG> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
<LI><STRONG>K.</STRONG> In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
<LI><STRONG>L.</STRONG> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
<LI><STRONG>M.</STRONG> Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
<LI><STRONG>N.</STRONG> Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
</UL>
<P>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
<P>
You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
<P>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
<P>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
<P>

<STRONG>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</STRONG>
<P>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.
<P>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
<P>
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."
<P>

<STRONG>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</STRONG>
<P>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
<P>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
<P>


<STRONG>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</STRONG>
<P>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
<P>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
<P>

<STRONG>8. TRANSLATION</STRONG>
<P>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.
<P>

<STRONG>9. TERMINATION</STRONG>
<P>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
<P>

<STRONG>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</STRONG>
<P>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
<P>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
