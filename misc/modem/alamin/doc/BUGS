000001	May 15, 2000
	DESCRIPTION: Zombie processes appears
	STATUS: CORRECTED
	NOTES: Old implementation without signaling support.

000002	June 13, 2000
	DESCRIPTION: Sometimes, the IMP that tryes to send a message is
	hang waiting for the socket to be accepted.
	STATUS: CORRECTED
	NOTES: Old implementation with some deadlock situations.

000003	June 27, 2000
	DESCRIPTION: Nokia PremiCell AT+ modem sometimes hungs and
	requires to be rebooted manually. This is not a GSG bug, just only
	a misconfigured serial line without hardware flow control (see
	stty ctrcts).
	STATUS: CORRECTED
	NOTES: Be sure that stty is properly configured with your modem
	defaults.

000004	November 4, 2000
	DESCRIPTION: gsgimp-* are not fully tested and they can be used to
	gain root privileges by an attacker.
	STATUS: PENDING
	NOTES: gsgimp-* are not fully tested. Some of them can be
	vulnerable to attacks trying to get root privileges over the
	gateway system. None of that gsgimp-* files are used by default.
	Take care to test it as much as you can to ensure security to your
	system if you are going to use some of them. They are included as
	examples only.

000005	December 6, 2000
	DESCRIPTION: clients can connect to the server port and issue
	commands to be run in the server machine as the user runs the
	daemon.
	STATUS: CORRECTED
	NOTES: system calls have been changed to avoid this simple
	exploit (from version 0.3.5).

000006	December 19, 2000
	DESCRIPTION: chat string to send a message in the AT interface
	when the messages has more than one line is invalid. Chat fails.
	STATUS: CORRECTED (in 0.3.5a)
	NOTES: If you only use the gnokii interface, you are not affected.

000007	January 23, 2001
	DESCRIPTION: chat string to send a message in the AT interface
	is not correctly constructed. Empty lines are added between real
	lines.
	STATUS: CORRECTED (in 0.3.6)
	NOTES: If you only use the gnokii interface, you are not affected.

000008	January 23, 2001
PENDING	DESCRIPTION: A client can connect to smsqp port (11201 is the
	default) and it can do nothing, gsgcmd is then hang until
	connection is finished. gsgsmtpd is vulnerable too. This can be
	used to make simple DoS attacks.
	STATUS: PENDING
	NOTES: Make sure your smsqp and smtp ports for the gateway are
	only accesible from trusted networks. Hostile and public networks
	must be avoided until this bug be fixed. Use the allowip and
	denyip options.

000009	January 26, 2001
	DESCRIPTION: When you use gnokii 0.3.0 to access the gsm device,
	gsgmdd was lossing the first line of the message. This happens
	since Alamin distinguises gnokii versions 0.3.0 and 0.3.2.
	STATUS: CORRECTED (in 0.3.6)

000010	May 1, 2001
	DESCRIPTION: If a queued message can not be sent in its first
	attempt it is saved with not valid format to be retried later, so
	that message will be sent never. This error was introduced in
	0.3.6pre3.
	STATUS: CORRECTED (in 0.3.6)
