#
# 0.1.0 - April 13, 2000
#		First version.
#		Connection accepted using sockets to send message.
# 0.2.0 - April 18, 2000 to April 29, 2000
#		Program structure changed. Functionallities and
#		interfaces designed. GSM interface to Gnokii and SMTP
#		interface implemented.
# 0.2.1 - May 2, 2000
#		Added support to send to multiple phones at a time.
#		Truncate message if it is greater than 160 characters.
#		Check for flag file about concurrent use of gnokii.
#		Client can now send a message for multiple recipients.
#		First parameter must be the message, and next will be
#		recipients.
# 0.2.2 - May 16, 2000
#		fork deleted. Zombie deletion not implemented. Only
#		accepts one connection at a time. listen waits for
#		SOMAXCONN queued connections. Now uses standard libraries
#		and better error checking. Executable name has changed
#		from gsmsms* to gsg*.
# 0.2.3 - May 22, 2000
#		Partially recoded to use "stricted" Perl. Better error
#		checking. Client now needs a first argument with the
#		sender identification, to be saved in the accounting log.
#		First version of the AT interface has been added.
# 0.2.4 - May 23, 2000
#		The SMTP protocol has been rewrited. Error checking in the
#		AT interface has been added.
# 0.3.0 - June 6, 2000
#		First implementation of the gsg native protocol, gsgp.
#		First implementation of the Incoming Message Dispatcher,
#		from GNOKII and AT interfaces.
#		Writes events in the syslog using the local4 facility.
#		Does not use the Sys::Syslog perl module, instead uses the
#		"logger" program running it with the "system" function.
#		Home page of Alamin GSG is now at www.alamin.es.org.
#		Now gsgd uses fork in some places.
#		Some demo Input Messages Processors (IMPs)
#		have been implemented. IMPORTANT BUG: Sometimes, the IMP
#		that tryes to send a message is hang waiting for the
#		socket to be accepted. DO NOT USE THIS VERSION UNLESS YOU
#		NEED IT SERIOSLY FOR SOME REASON. YOU CAN USE IT HACKING
#		THE CODE.
# 0.3.1 - June 14, 2000
#		New structure to avoid the lock bug in 0.3.0. Now it
#		starts as a daemon and has been included in the init.d
#		Debian directory. The daemon has been separated in two
#		parts, gsgcmd (core module) and gsgmdd (message
#		dispatcher). Install and uninstall scripts have been
#		prepared. Some options are hardcoded inside the own
#		program code. They will be moved to the configuration file
#		in the next version. The AT interface has had some
#		hunging problems in an old 486/100 computer with (i don't
#		remember) uart, but runs ok in a 16550A	uart in a Pentium
#		II 266 computer.
#		Corrected the bug that hungs the AT device while
#		concurrent access to the device ocurrs.
#		The AT interface requires that the ttySx be correctly
#		configured, that is, be sure that stty reports the correct
#		settings, crtcts if required, cs8, noparity, etc.
# 0.3.2 - July 15, 2000
#		A bug in 0.3.1 when concurrent access to the ttySx device
#		using AT occurs has been fixed changing to a priority
#		spool mode. Nine queues exists now to send with different
#		priorities. All program configuration options
#		can now be included in the config file or in the command
#		line. New client for Unix/Linux (gsgc) with configuration
#		file and command line options, like gsgcmd and gsgmdd.
#		Retry when fail to send implemented now. You can define
#		the minutes between one try and another in a per queue
#		basis. Failed or successfully sent messages can be
#		archives or discarded. Maximum number of messages to
#		proccess in each cicle limited with maxin and maxout.
# 0.3.3 - September 26, 2000
#		Added new command line options and config file options:
#		syslog/nosyslog, gnokiipath, chatpath, sttypath and
#		sttystring. Multiple line incoming messages using gnokii
#		are now supported. Syslog facility is now configurable
#		using the syslog option. gsmdevice option has changed its
#		sintax to accept options for each interface acepted. See
#		example config file for more information. Added options
#		imp and imptype to define the command to run when a
#		message arrives.
# 0.3.4 - November 4, 2000
#		Support for different versions of gnokii. Currently, 0.3.0
#		and 0.3.2 are tested. gsgsmtpd is the daemon that provides
#		the smtp interface. gsgcmd can receive a message to be
#		sent to multiple destinations, not only one. gsgc has been
#		modified to allow a message to be sent to multiple
#		destinations at the same time. umask modified to allow
#		only read/write for propietary and group, not others. smtp
#		interface allows formating of the message to be sent over
#		GSM. Added --help and --version command line options. A
#		new example of input message processor is included,
#		gsgimp-sms2email.
# 0.3.5 - December 17, 2000
#		Security improvements. Run as other user than root.
#		Changed permissions over the spool directory and all other
#		directories used. System calls have been changed to
#		avoid commands to be run in the server
#		from client requests. Service names can now be used
#		instead of port numbers. Install script now puts programs
#		in /usr/sbin and /usr/bin directories, instead of
#		/usr/local. IP address is now logged with the client name
#		when a connection is received.
#		Weekly log rotation script has been added and it
#		is scheduled inside the /etc/cron.weekly directory.
# 0.3.5a - December 20, 2000
#		Some light errors in the AT interface and inside the
#		startup script gsgd to run in Debian slink.
# 0.3.6 - May 6, 2001
#		logger is no longer used. Sys::Syslog perl module is used
#		instead. Warnings reading config file are now displayed
#		instead of being logged in syslog (most of them are only
#		debug messages). Facility to log message is now allocated
#		dinamically, using the syslog-facility script provided by
#		the syslog package. Uninstall script takes care to remove
#		the syslog.conf lines added during installation script.
#		AT interface sending an SMS: Only 159 characters are sent
#		now, Nokia Premicell only accepts 159 chars, 160th may be
#		used by the Ctrl-Z at the end, i supose. Chat script to
#		send a message has been changed to supress empty lines
#		between all lines. Ctrl-E has been added at the start of
#		the getsms chat script to cancel pending send request
#		that may be open due to a communications failure between
#		the computer and the gsm modem in a previous chat
#		conversation. Added --pidfile option in gsgcmd, gsgmdd and
#		gsgsmtpd. aliasfile option allows to use alias words as
#		destination numbers, and to send messages to groups. The
#		default file for aliasfile option is alias.conf.
#		gnokii interface for version 0.3.0 was lossing the first
#		line of each message, corrected. You can now send using
#		other smscs. This can be used in a gateway decision or
#		by the client decision. allowip and denyip options to
#		decide if an incoming ip connection must be accepted or
#		not. usersfile option (user.conf) to allow/deny different
#		users to access the gateway services. It uses a CHAP
#		similiar scheme to authenticate the client. Destination
#		control per user using some numbers or a file with a list
#		of phone numbers. Startup script has changed its name,
#		from gsgd to alamin. Man pages for gsgc, gsgcmd, gsgmdd,
#		gsgsmtpd and alamin (startup script).
