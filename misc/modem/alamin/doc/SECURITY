# Alamin GSM SMS Gateway - SECURITY NOTE
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# (C) Andrés Seco Hernández, April 2000-May 2001
#

As this gateway has been wrote in Perl, it must have the tainted option
(-T), but, at the present stage of development, this option causes some
problems, and has beed decided not to use it now.

Security is a prime target, because of that, the gateway has been tested
under many conditions, and the install script takes care to set it as
secure as i know.

Calls to the "system" Perl function has been tested with all options that
i can imagine to be used to get a hole, but i can't get any problem.

Please, if you find any security issue or recomendation, email me at
AndresSH@alamin.org with details.

Currently, a simple DoS attack can be made as bug 000008 describes. You
need now to allow ip access only from trusted networks. Use the allowip
and denyip options. You can avoid this DoS attack using redir to check for
timeout connections until timeout will be implemented inside the daemons.
See startup script (gsgd) for example on using redir.

Client that uses smsqp (sms queue protocol) can authenticate itself using
a CHAP similar method. When it sends the "user" command, the gateway
answers with a challenge string, that the client must use with the
password to generate a response string. Both, client and server, make
use of the "Digest::MD5" perl module.

Please, if you think that any part of the user/password authentication
process has any mistake, please, notify me. I would like to keep it as
secure as we can.

I am not sure if the RSA license must be included here because the use of
the MD5 hash, so, here it is:

	The MD5 algorithm is defined in RFC 1321. The basic C code
	implementing the algorithm is derived from that in the RFC
	and is covered by the following copyright:
