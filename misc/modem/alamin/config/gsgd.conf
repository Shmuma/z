# Alamin GSM SMS Gateway default server config file for version 0.3.6
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# /etc/alamin/gsgd.conf is the default config file
#
# Specify other config file using the --configfile command line option.
#
# The configfile option is not valid inside a config file (to redirect
# into another config file).
#
# You can put any number of times an option inside the config file, but
# only the latest is used. Use only lowercase letters. Options specified
# in the command line have preference over options listed here.

# NOTE: if your /etc/services file doesn't include the smsqp service,
# you can include the following line to it:
# smsqp		11201/tcp			# SMS queue protocol
# if smsqp can't be located, 11201 is the default value used

# gsmdevice <gsmdevice_type> <gsmdevice_mode> <device_serial_port> -
# default "gsmdevice at text /dev/gsm"
# used by gsgmdd
# NOTE: currently, only "at" and "gnokii" can be used as <gsmdevice_type>.
# "at" uses the "chat" program to dialogue with the gsm device, and "stty"
# to configure the serial port. <gsmdevice_mode> can be "text" or "pdu" to
# use the text mode or pdu mode in the at interface. Currently, only
# "text" is implemented.
# "gnokii" uses the Gnokii project command line binary. Versions 0.3.0 and
# 0.3.2 of Gnokii have been succesfully tested. <gsmdevice_mode> is the
# gnokii version you use, because the differences in the output format
# in differents versions. The <device_serial_port> option is ignored in
# this case. It will be used in the future to support more than one gsm
# device attached to the same computer.
# You can make /dev/gsm to be a symbolic link to the device serial port
# where you attach the modem or the phone (ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/gsm) or
# use the original device name in the gsmdevice option.

# sttystring <serial_port_initialization_string>
# default "sttystring"
# used by gsgmdd
# NOTE: This option is not used if you select "gnokii" in the
# gsmdevice option.
# If you have communication problems between your computer and the gsm
# modem, configure the serial port using a program like minicom and exit
# from it without reseting the communications port ("Quit with no reset"
# in minicom). Then, run "stty -g </dev/ttyS0" (change ttyS0 with your
# serial port name). The output of that command is what you want to put
# here as the parameter for stty to configure your serial port each time
# Alamin starts. The example shows an string to configure a serial port to
# 9600 bps, 8 bits per character, 1 stop bit, no parity, hardware flow
# control and... i don't remember more characteristics. Read your gsm
# modem manual for your requirements.
